# image_generation_with_DALL-E
In this file I build off an existing notebook and try to tune hyper parameters to improve the quality of the outputted images. Images are generated using DALL-E and CLIP 
from an inputted text. 

# image_captioning_with_attention
In this file I go through a tensorfow tutorial and play around this the model of creating captions from images. I try and tune the hyperparameters as well but had much less
success than the other notebook.
